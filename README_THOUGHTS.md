### Note: Understanding the Two README Files

This project contains two README files to provide clear and detailed context:

1. **`README_RUN_CODE.md`**: This file contains all the instructions for setting up, running the code, and interpreting the results. If youâ€™re looking to execute the code and analyze its outputs, this is the file you should start with.

2. **`README_THOUGHTS.md`**: This file explains my thought process, design decisions, challenges faced, and alternative approaches considered while solving the coding challenge. It offers deeper insight into the logic and reasoning behind the implementation. 

Feel free to refer to each README based on your purpose: whether you want to run the code or understand the rationale behind it!
