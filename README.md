# Note: Understanding the Two README Files

This project contains two README files to provide clear and detailed context:

1. **`README_RUN_CODE.md`**: This file contains all the instructions for setting up, running the code, and interpreting the results. If youâ€™re looking to execute the code and analyze its outputs, this is the file you should start with.

2. **`README_THOUGHTS.md`**: This file explains my thought process, design decisions, challenges faced, and alternative approaches considered while solving the coding challenge. It offers deeper insight into the logic and reasoning behind the implementation. 

Feel free to refer to each README based on your purpose: whether you want to run the code or understand the rationale behind it!

### Disclaimer

Honest and transparent communication is something I genuinely live by, and I want to share that I did use ChatGPT to assist me with certain aspects of this project. Specifically, ChatGPT was used to help with:
- Cleaning code (e.g., organizing imports, writing docstrings).
- Writing test cases (even though they might not be a requirement for this challenge, writing tests is a habit I follow to ensure code reliability).
- Adding `logger.info()` statements in the code for better traceability.
- Formatting this README for clarity and professionalism.
- Addressing minor, tedious Pythonic bugs.

However, I want to clarify that ChatGPT **was not used** for:
- The implementation of the code logic.
- Code design (e.g., object-oriented programming structure, file/folder organization, and key implementation decisions).

This project reflects my thought process, problem-solving ability, and skills. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to showcase my approach to this challenge!
