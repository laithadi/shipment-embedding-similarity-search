# Take Home Coding Challenge - DataGPT

Hello DataGPT Team,

My name is **Laith Adi**, and I am a Machine Learning Engineer and a soon-to-be PhD student. I am incredibly excited to be interviewing for your company and contributing to the development of your innovative product. The opportunity to engage with DataGPT's mission and explore this challenge has been both exciting and rewarding.

This is my submission for the **Take Home Coding Challenge**. In this README, I will:
- Provide instructions for running the code and interpreting the results.
- Outline my thought process as I approached the challenge.
- Discuss the implementation details.
- Highlight potential alternative approaches and their trade-offs.

Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!

Best regards,  
Laith Adi




## Disclaimer

Honest and transparent communication is something I genuinely live by, and I want to share that I did use ChatGPT to assist me with certain aspects of this project. Specifically, ChatGPT was used to help with:
- Cleaning code (e.g., organizing imports, writing docstrings).
- Writing test cases (even though they might not be a requirement for this challenge, writing tests is a habit I follow to ensure code reliability).
- Adding `logger.info()` statements in the code for better traceability.
- Formatting this README for clarity and professionalism.
- Addressing minor, tedious Pythonic bugs.

However, I want to clarify that ChatGPT **was not used** for:
- The implementation of the code logic.
- Code design (e.g., object-oriented programming structure, file/folder organization, and key implementation decisions).

This project reflects my thought process, problem-solving ability, and skills. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to showcase my approach to this challenge!
