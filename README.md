# Take Home Coding Challenge - DataGPT

Hello DataGPT Team,

My name is **Laith Adi**, and I am a Machine Learning Engineer and a soon-to-be PhD student. I am incredibly excited to be interviewing for your company and contributing to the development of your innovative product. The opportunity to engage with DataGPT's mission and explore this challenge has been both exciting and rewarding.

This is my submission for the **Take Home Coding Challenge**. 

Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!

Best regards,  
Laith Adi

# Note: Understanding the Two README Files

This project contains two README files to provide clear and detailed context:

1. **`README_RUN_CODE.md`**: This file contains all the instructions for setting up, running the code, and interpreting the results. If youâ€™re looking to execute the code and analyze its outputs, this is the file you should start with.

2. **`README_THOUGHTS.md`**: This file explains my thought process, design decisions, challenges faced, and alternative approaches considered while solving the coding challenge. It offers deeper insight into the logic and reasoning behind the implementation. 

Feel free to refer to each README based on your purpose: whether you want to run the code or understand the rationale behind it!
